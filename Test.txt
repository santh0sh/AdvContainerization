Automation of SSH Key Highlights

Current Draft:

Our strategy is to leverage the automation tool for SSH key management and connectivity checks as per GIS standard.

Developed ansible scripts that update SSH keys using an abstract template and Autosys jobs to check SSH connectivity for replication servers.

Manual progress of this for 150+ servers on Flagscape application consumes 180 hours per cycle (time consuming and susceptible to human error).

Automation will get this done in 10 hours for all environments with precision.

This solution easily scales to accommodate additional servers or change SSH key management policies without additional manual effort.

Plans are in pipeline to have talks with Horizon team to promote this template for all the applications.


Suggested Improvements:

Our strategy involves leveraging automation tools to manage SSH keys and perform connectivity checks in accordance with GIS standards.

Ansible scripts were developed to update SSH keys using an abstract template, complemented by Autosys jobs to validate SSH connectivity for replication servers.

Manual processing of this task for 150+ servers on the Flagscape application currently consumes 180 hours per cycle, making it both time-intensive and prone to human error.

With automation, this task will be completed within 10 hours across all environments, ensuring precision.

The solution is highly scalable, facilitating the integration of additional servers and seamless changes to SSH key management policies without further manual intervention.

Discussions with the Horizon team are planned to promote the adoption of this template across all applications.


KMS Key Highlights

Current Draft:

Offshore team started being integral part of KMS deliverables.

Delivered over 25% of Q3 stories with 50+ story points.

Had good hold on Workflow/Management page changes on KMS application.


Suggested Improvements:

The offshore team has become an integral part of the KMS deliverables.

Successfully delivered over 25% of Q3 stories, totaling 50+ story points.

Demonstrated strong proficiency in managing Workflow and implementing changes in the KMS application.


Build Tool Migration Key Points

Current Draft:

Inhouse CI does not support multiple build pipelines and build time is higher with current system.

All artifacts moved to single build pipeline and removed all dependency jars from repository in sync with desired standards.

Integrated Unit test for all legacy modules in the new pipeline.

Faster build time and opens door for module segregation and made it easy for OpenText upgrade.


Suggested Improvements:

The in-house CI system does not support multiple build pipelines, resulting in longer build times.

All artifacts have been consolidated into a single build pipeline, and dependency jars have been removed from the repository to align with standard practices.

Unit testing for all legacy modules has been integrated into the new pipeline.

The new build process has significantly reduced build times, facilitated module segregation, and streamlined the OpenText upgrade process.
