"Hey team! Today, we’re going to talk about our recent initiative: the migration of Flagscape from Ant to Maven. This was a big project, spanning from July to September 2024, with a few key goals and some valuable lessons learned along the way. So let’s break it down!

Project Goals and Objectives:
Our main goal was to modernize and streamline the build process. We were working with dual pipelines in Ant, which wasn’t compatible with Horizon’s requirements for a unified build process. Moving to Maven allowed us to create a more efficient and cohesive build structure, which ultimately makes things easier to manage and cuts down on build times.

Scope of the Project:
The scope was clear: build a scalable, maintainable, and efficient system that aligns with today’s development practices. By switching to Maven, we’re now in line with modern standards and have a strong foundation for handling artifacts more effectively.

Challenges We Faced:
Of course, no migration is without its bumps! First, we had to manage custom JAR dependencies across submodules to make sure nothing broke along the way. Then, there was the challenge of ensuring compatibility with older components—nobody wanted to rely on old Ant scripts! Lastly, we had to make sure this transition didn’t disrupt our existing CI/CD pipelines, like Jenkins. But with careful planning and testing, we pulled it off smoothly.

Highlights and Wins:
Now, let’s talk about what went right! Maven’s built-in dependency management saved us time and reduced manual work on library updates. Plus, the structured Maven lifecycle—things like compile, test, and package—made it easier for us to manage complex builds. Overall, this transition has already started paying off in terms of efficiency.

Impact and Takeaways:
The migration has had a big impact on our workflow. Project management has become much smoother, builds are more stable, and the team is now more comfortable with Maven, which opens the door for us to integrate other modern tools down the line.

Wrap-Up:
So, in short, migrating to Maven was a great step forward. It was a challenging but rewarding experience, and we’re already seeing the benefits in our day-to-day work. Thanks for everyone’s hard work on this, and I’m excited to see what we can achieve with this new setup!"
