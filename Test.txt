Problem Statement
Multiple clients directly access backend services, causing duplicated authentication logic, inconsistent policies, brittle endpoints, and fragmented monitoring. This increases security risks, slows changes, and makes governance harder.

Solution
Introduce an API Gateway as a single secure entry point to all backend services. Centralize authentication, rate limiting, routing, caching, and request transformations. Provide unified logging, metrics, and tracing for full observability. Enable canary releases, policy enforcement, and traffic shaping to reduce change risk, improve performance, and allow backend services to evolve without breaking clients.
