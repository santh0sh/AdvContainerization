Title:

Boosting Code Quality and Test Coverage using SonarLint, SonarQube & GitHub Copilot

Concept/Demo Description:

This demo showcases how a developer can significantly improve code quality and unit test coverage by integrating SonarLint for real-time feedback, SonarQube for centralized quality analysis, and GitHub Copilot for intelligent code and test generation. The flow demonstrates how SonarLint flags issues during coding, how Copilot assists in writing cleaner logic and unit tests, and how SonarQube validates improvements via quality gates and coverage reports. This integrated approach accelerates development while reducing technical debt.
