As part of the CMS POC initiative aimed at evaluating a potential in-house replacement for the current Newsroom and Flagscape applications, this task focuses on implementing and validating a specific area of functionality. The goal is to explore technical feasibility, assess integration capabilities, and establish a foundational structure for scalable development.

This sub-task specifically covers: [Insert specific focus here, e.g., creating DB tables, developing Spring Boot endpoints, exploring content versioning strategies].


---

Acceptance Criteria:

The implementation aligns with the overall CMS architecture and design principles defined in the spike.

The solution demonstrates technical feasibility and addresses integration considerations where applicable.

Deliverables (code/config/artifacts) are committed to the POC branch/repository with relevant documentation.

Observations, blockers, or findings are captured and shared for discussion in the spike review session.
