Strategy

During our migration to ReactJS, Kendo UI was selected as a component library due to its prior usage in various EET applications. While this provided immediate compatibility, Kendo UI requires an individual developer license rather than a corporate license, leading to ongoing annual licensing costs of $1400 per developer. To optimize costs and streamline development, we propose transitioning to custom React-based components that offer the same functionality without licensing constraints.


---

Current State

Licensing Challenge: The current Telerik Kendo UI license is tied to individual developers, making it non-compliant with corporate best practices.

Inefficient License Management: Storing license files in our repository introduces compliance risks and complicates governance.

Recurring Cost: Annual renewal of the $1400 per developer license results in unnecessary financial overhead.



---

Target Outcomes

To address these challenges, we propose developing custom React-based components to replace Kendo UIâ€™s Tree component. This approach will:

Eliminate licensing costs while maintaining functionality.

Utilize cost-effective, scalable, and open-source React components.

Enhance governance, compliance, and security by removing dependency on individual licenses.



---

Benefit Calculation

Replacing Kendo UI with React-based components will result in:

Direct cost savings of $1400 per developer annually.

No ongoing licensing fees, ensuring long-term financial benefits.

Operational efficiency by eliminating license management efforts.



---

Business Benefit

No yearly renewal required: The new solution will be a fully custom, in-house component.

Sustainable and scalable: Future-proofing development by avoiding vendor lock-in.

Compliance & risk mitigation: Eliminates dependency on individual developer licenses, ensuring corporate governance best practices.


> Estimated Benefit: Cost savings of $1400 per developer annually
