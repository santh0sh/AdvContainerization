Subject: Availability on Friday

Hi Robin,

I wanted to inform you that I had to log off early last Friday due to some personal matters related to my home shifting. I also misplaced my phone and could retrieve it only today. Apologies for the missed callsâ€”I'm working on catching up and ensuring continuity.

Best regards,
Santhosh
