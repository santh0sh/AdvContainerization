During our ReactJS migration, Kendo UI was used but required a $1400 per developer annual license, causing cost and compliance issues. We propose replacing it with custom React-based components, eliminating costs, ensuring compliance, and enhancing scalability. This will save expenses, remove license risks, and improve long-term sustainability.
